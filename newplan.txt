7-Day Action Plan for AI-Powered 30-Day Course Challenge Teams App

Day 1: Requirements & Project Setup
- Review the project goal: An app for employees to enroll in a 30-day AI-driven MCQ course, integrated with Microsoft Teams.
- List all features: enrollment, daily AI-generated MCQs, wrong answer tracking, repeat questions, Teams integration.
- Set up the project folder and ensure all dependencies (Python, Teams SDK, Azure/AWS SDKs) are installed.
- Create or review a README.md with project overview and requirements.

Day 2: Teams App Registration & Manifest
- Register the app in Microsoft Teams Developer Portal.
- Create or update appPackage/manifest.json with app details, bot endpoint, and permissions.
- Add app icons (color.png, outline.png).
- Prepare the app for sideloading in Teams for testing.

Day 3: User Enrollment & Data Storage
- Design the data model for user enrollment, progress, and wrong answer tracking (e.g., userId, courseId, day, wrongQueue).
- Implement backend logic (in src/bot.py or app.py) for user enrollment and storing user data.
- Set up a database or storage solution (Azure Table Storage, Cosmos DB, or similar).
- Test enrollment flow and data persistence.

Day 4: AI Question Generation
- Integrate with an AI service (Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, or similar) to generate 10 daily MCQs for each user.
- Design a question schema (question, options, correct answer, explanation, tags).
- Implement logic to mix in previously incorrect questions (wrongQueue) with new ones.
- Test question generation and storage.

Day 5: Daily Quiz Delivery & Answer Handling
- Implement logic to send daily quizzes to enrolled users in Teams (using Adaptive Cards for MCQs).
- Handle user responses, evaluate answers, and update progress and wrongQueue.
- Provide feedback to users on correct/incorrect answers.
- Test the full daily quiz and answer flow in Teams.

Day 6: Scheduling & Reminders
- Set up a scheduler (Azure Function, Logic App, or background task) to trigger daily quiz delivery and reminders.
- Implement proactive messaging to remind users to complete their daily quiz.
- Test scheduling and reminder functionality.

Day 7: Final Testing, Packaging & Documentation
- Simulate the 30-day flow for a test user to ensure all features work as intended.
- Fix any bugs or issues found during testing.
- Update README.md with setup, usage, and troubleshooting instructions.
- Package the Teams app (manifest + icons) and upload for final testing.
- Review all code, configs, and documentation for completeness and security.
