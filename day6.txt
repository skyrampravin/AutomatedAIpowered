Day 6: Sandbox Testing & Reliability Management (Detailed Plan)

## Comprehensive Sandbox Testing Framework

1. Implement SandboxTestSuite Class
- Create tests/sandbox_test_suite.py for comprehensive testing
- Test all sandbox components: storage, question generation, answer evaluation
- Implement automated testing that works with playground file structure
- Enable rapid testing cycles for sandbox development

2. Build Sandbox Reliability Management
- Create src/sandbox_reliability.py for error handling and recovery
- Implement resilient file operations with retry logic
- Add automatic backup and restore functionality for playground data
- Monitor sandbox environment health and performance

3. Create Sandbox Monitoring Dashboard
- Implement /admin endpoint for real-time sandbox monitoring
- Display user statistics, system health, and performance metrics
- Create automated health checks and alerting for sandbox environment
- Generate daily reports for sandbox usage and performance

4. Test Complete User Journey in Sandbox
- Simulate complete 30-day learning journey for multiple users
- Test enrollment, daily quizzes, progress tracking, and completion
- Verify data consistency and integrity throughout user journey
- Validate sandbox performance under realistic usage scenarios

5. Implement Sandbox Load Testing
- Test sandbox system with multiple concurrent users
- Validate file-based storage performance under load
- Identify and resolve potential bottlenecks in sandbox environment
- Ensure sandbox can handle expected user base efficiently

6. Create Sandbox Backup and Recovery System
- Implement automated daily backups of playground/data/
- Create easy restore functionality for sandbox data
- Test backup and recovery procedures thoroughly
- Ensure data safety and business continuity for sandbox deployment

7. Alternative: Azure Proactive Messaging (For Azure Deployment)
- If using Azure path, implement Azure Functions for daily scheduling
- Set up Azure Logic Apps for automated quiz delivery
- Configure proactive messaging using Azure Bot Service
- Note: Requires Azure infrastructure and additional complexity

8. Sandbox vs Production Automation
- **Sandbox**: Manual quiz initiation via /quiz command (immediate testing)
- **Production**: Automated daily scheduling via Azure Functions
- **Hybrid**: Sandbox for development, Azure automation for specific deployments

## Sandbox Testing Benefits
- ✅ Comprehensive testing without infrastructure complexity
- ✅ Immediate feedback on system reliability and performance
- ✅ Easy debugging through file system inspection
- ✅ Rapid test iterations and optimization cycles
- ✅ Cost-effective reliability validation

## Reliability Features
1. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry for failed operations
2. **Data Integrity**: Validation and consistency checks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking
4. **Health Checks**: Automated system health validation
5. **Backup System**: Automated data protection

9. Prepare for Day 7 (Production Readiness)
- Validate all sandbox components work together reliably
- Document sandbox deployment and maintenance procedures
- Prepare migration path to Azure for production scaling
- Create comprehensive deployment guide for sandbox and Azure options

**Sandbox Reliability Advantage:** File-based storage provides transparent reliability monitoring and easy recovery procedures, making sandbox deployment highly reliable for MVP and proof-of-concept scenarios.
