Day 5: Sandbox Answer Evaluation & Progress Analytics (Detailed Plan)

## Sandbox Answer Processing System

1. Implement SandboxAnswerEvaluator Class
- Create src/sandbox_answer_evaluator.py for answer processing
- Evaluate user answers submitted via Teams Adaptive Cards
- Update progress tracking using file-based storage system
- Provide immediate feedback and explanations to users

2. Build Sandbox Progress Tracking
- Track user scores and progress in playground/data/{user_id}_progress.json
- Implement streak calculation and learning momentum tracking
- Manage wrong answer queue in playground/data/{user_id}_wrong_questions.json
- Create comprehensive progress analytics for sandbox environment

3. Implement Sandbox Feedback System
- Provide immediate correct/incorrect feedback via Teams messages
- Generate AI-powered explanations for wrong answers using OpenAI
- Create motivational messages and progress celebrations
- Store feedback history for learning pattern analysis

4. Create Sandbox Progress Analytics
- Calculate daily, weekly, and overall progress percentages
- Track learning streaks and achievement milestones
- Generate progress reports accessible via /progress command
- Store analytics in playground/data/{user_id}_analytics.json

5. Test Answer Evaluation in Sandbox
- Simulate answering questions through ngrok Teams interface
- Verify progress updates are correctly stored in playground files
- Test wrong answer queue management and re-quiz functionality
- Debug answer evaluation by examining JSON files directly

6. Implement Sandbox Learning Optimization
- Analyze wrong answer patterns from playground data files
- Optimize question difficulty based on user performance
- Implement adaptive learning paths using local file analytics
- Create personalized learning recommendations

7. Add Sandbox Monitoring and Reporting
- Create /admin command to view all user progress statistics
- Implement progress visualization and trend analysis
- Generate daily progress reports for all sandbox users
- Enable easy performance monitoring and optimization

8. Alternative: Azure Analytics Integration
- If using Azure path, integrate with Azure Analytics services
- Store progress data in Azure Tables or Cosmos DB
- Use Azure Functions for automated progress calculations
- Note: Requires Azure infrastructure and additional complexity

## Sandbox Progress Benefits
- ✅ Immediate progress tracking without database setup
- ✅ Easy progress inspection and debugging via JSON files
- ✅ Rapid analytics development and testing
- ✅ Cost-effective progress analytics (no Azure Analytics costs)
- ✅ Simple backup and restore of user progress

## Progress Data Structure
```
playground/
├── data/
│   ├── user123_progress.json        # Overall progress metrics
│   ├── user123_wrong_questions.json # Wrong answer queue
│   ├── user123_analytics.json       # Learning analytics
│   └── user123_achievements.json    # Milestones and streaks
└── reports/
    ├── daily_progress_summary.json  # Daily progress report
    └── user_performance_trends.json # Performance analytics
```

## Testing Strategy
1. **Answer Processing**: Test correct/incorrect answer handling
2. **Progress Calculation**: Verify progress percentages and streaks
3. **Wrong Question Queue**: Test re-quiz functionality
4. **Analytics Generation**: Validate progress reports and trends
5. **Performance**: Monitor answer evaluation speed

9. Prepare for Day 6 (Testing & Reliability)
- Plan comprehensive testing framework for sandbox environment
- Design reliability and monitoring systems for sandbox deployment
- Prepare for implementing SandboxTestSuite and monitoring tools
- Ensure all sandbox components work together seamlessly
