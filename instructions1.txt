Step-by-step (AWS + Microsoft Teams)
0) Prereqs
* A Microsoft 365 tenant with permission to upload custom apps to Teams.
* AWS account with access to Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, EventBridge, Secrets Manager, and (optionally) Bedrock.

1) Register the bot with Microsoft (so Teams can reach your AWS endpoint)
1. Create an Azure Bot resource (channel registration) to obtain a Microsoft App ID and set a password (client secret).
2. Enable the Microsoft Teams channel for the bot.
3. Temporarily set the messaging endpoint to a placeholder; you’ll replace it with your API Gateway URL after deployment. Microsoft Learn+1
Why this matters: Teams only delivers messages to endpoints associated with a registered bot. Registration doesn’t force you to host on Azure—you can host your bot anywhere (AWS) as long as the public HTTPS endpoint is reachable.

2) Provision AWS foundation
* Secrets Manager: store MICROSOFT_APP_ID, MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD, and (if used) external LLM keys.
* DynamoDB (e.g., table LearningApp):
    * PK: userId
    * SK: courseId#day
    * Attributes: score, answers, wrongQueue[], status (e.g., in_progress/completed), lastActivityAt.
* CloudWatch Logs: enabled by default with Lambda for observability.

3) Choose AI generation
* If you want fully on-AWS AI, enable Amazon Bedrock access to your preferred model(s) and call the Bedrock Runtime from Lambda to generate daily MCQs. See JS SDK examples and InvokeModel. AWS Documentation+1

4) Implement the bot (Node.js recommended)
* Use Bot Framework SDK v4 in a Lambda function. Create an adapter (BotFrameworkHttpAdapter) using your Microsoft App ID/Password (pulled from Secrets Manager), and handle POST /api/messages to call adapter.processActivity(...). Microsoft Learn
Core handlers you’ll write:
* enrollUser(courseId) – initialize Day 1 record in DynamoDB.
* generateDailyQuiz(user, day) – call Bedrock/OpenAI to produce 10 MCQs; mix in previously wrong questions.
* renderQuizAsAdaptiveCards(questions) – send MCQs as Adaptive Cards with radio choices and Action.Submit. Microsoft Learn+1
* evaluateAnswer(payload) – check choice, update DynamoDB (wrongQueue if incorrect).
* completeDay(user, day) – persist score; schedule tomorrow’s reminder (see Step 7).
Tip: Keep a lightweight “question schema” (stem, options A–D, correctIndex, explanation, source/topic tags) so regeneration and re-asking are deterministic.

5) Put the bot behind a public AWS URL
Option A (most common): API Gateway (HTTP API) → Lambda (proxy integration).
* Create an HTTP API with a POST /api/messages route → integrate with your Lambda.
* Enable a custom domain if wanted, HTTPS is required. AWS Documentation+2AWS Documentation+2
Alternative: ALB → Lambda is also viable if you prefer ALB features for webhooks.

6) Wire Teams → AWS
* Take the API Gateway invoke URL (e.g., https://xyz.execute-api.../api/messages) and update the Azure Bot resource’s Messaging endpoint with it; keep Teams channel enabled.
* Install your app in Teams and start chatting with the bot. Microsoft Learn

7) Daily reminders & progress nudges (proactive messages)
* Save the conversation reference for each user on first contact.
* Create a daily EventBridge Scheduler (cron) that invokes a Lambda which:
    1. Looks up users who haven’t completed today,
    2. Uses the conversation reference to send a proactive message (“Day 7 is ready!”). AWS Documentation+1Microsoft Learn+1

8) Re-asking wrong answers (adaptive learning loop)
* Keep a wrongQueue per course. When generating the next day’s 10 questions, sample 2–4 from wrongQueue and the rest new questions from the same topic area.
* On correct resolution, evict from wrongQueue. (Logic is app-level; no special service needed.)

9) Optional: Add a Teams Tab for dashboards
* Host a small React/Next.js progress dashboard on S3 + CloudFront.
* Add it as a static tab in your Teams app manifest (contentUrl → CloudFront URL).
* Use Adaptive Cards in chat for daily quizzes; use the Tab for richer analytics, streaks, and certificates. Microsoft Learn+2Microsoft Learn+2

10) Package & upload the Teams app
* Build a Teams manifest referencing your bot’s Microsoft App ID (from the Azure Bot resource).
* Include (optionally) your Tab definition.
* Zip the manifest with icons; upload it to Teams (tenant app catalog) and test. Microsoft Learn

11) Production hardening
* Secrets: keep creds in Secrets Manager; rotate regularly.
* Retry & idempotency: Bot messages can be retried; ensure your handlers are idempotent.
* Observability: Use CloudWatch Logs & metrics; consider DLQs for failed reminder events.
* Concurrency: Set Lambda memory/concurrency to handle quiz spikes.
* Security headers: If you add a Tab, make sure CSP/X-Frame-Options allow rendering inside Teams. Microsoft Learn

12) Nice extras
* Certificates: Generate a completion certificate PDF on Day 30 (Lambda + S3).
* Admin panel: simple CRUD to define/curate course taxonomies and seed topics.
* Content mixing: interleave mini-explanations after each question to reinforce.
